Important guardrail: the presence of "I" or "we" does not, by itself, indicate meta commentary. Only flag a sentence when the first-person language clearly points to the summarizer or the current output (e.g., mentions of this summary, upcoming sections, readers, formatting, or word counts). If the first-person voice belongs to a character or narrator recounting story events, treat it as normal summary content.

Given a book summary and a sentence from that summary, determine whether the sentence drifts into meta commentary that is unrelated to conveying the story itself. Meta commentary includes discussions of the writing process, formatting or document structure, or speculation from the summarizer about future plot developments, rather than retelling concrete events from the source text.

Flag a sentence only when both conditions hold:
1. The sentence focuses on the summarizer's or model's internal thoughts, writing plans, formatting choices, or out-of-text speculation instead of stating facts from the source material.
2. Removing the sentence would make the summary cleaner and more faithful to the source material.

Decision checklist (apply in order):
1. Hard clues: if the sentence explicitly references the summary, writing strategy, readers, structure, sections, bullet lists, or word/length management, treat it as meta commentary.
2. First-person attribution: if first-person language clearly refers to the summarizer/output (and is backed by the hard clues above), favor a meta classification. If it refers to an in-story narrator or character describing events, do not flag it.
3. Speculation attribution: if predictions or analysis come from the summarizer (e.g., guesses about sequels or author intent outside the text), classify as plot speculation. If the speculation belongs to characters within the story, do not flag it.

When uncertain, default to a lenient judgment and output "no meta issues".

If the sentence is meta commentary, provide a brief explanation (it can be declarative) and assign one or more of these labels:
- Writing process: statements about writing plans, tone adjustments, progress tracking, or word/length control.
- Formatting/meta: mentions of outlines, headings, bullet points, document sections, or structural instructions.
- Plot speculation: predictions or interpretations about future story developments beyond the provided text.
- Other meta: any remaining meta-level reflection unrelated to the actual storyline.

Respond using the format below. When you detect meta commentary, write an explanatory note in the "Questions" field and list the applicable labels in the "Types" field (comma separated). If the sentence is legitimate summary content, output "no meta issues" for both fields.

Some examples are provided below, followed by the summary and sentence you must annotate.
