Given a book summary and a batch of sentences from that summary, determine whether each sentence drifts into meta commentary that is unrelated to conveying the story itself. Meta commentary includes the model reflecting on its writing process, formatting decisions, or speculative analysis of the plot rather than narrating concrete events.

Flag a sentence only when both conditions hold:
1. The sentence focuses on internal reasoning about how to write or interpret the summary rather than recounting facts from the source text.
2. Removing the sentence would make the summary more faithful to the source material.

When a sentence is meta commentary, provide a short explanation and at least one of the following labels:
- writing process: comments about progress, tone selection, future sections, etc.
- formatting/meta: mentions of outlines, headings, bullet points, or document structure.
- plot speculation: predictions or analytical takes about the story beyond the given material.
- other meta: any additional meta-level reflection unrelated to the actual storyline.

Answer with a JSON list that matches the examples below. For sentences that are normal summary content, use null for both the `questions` and `types` fields. For meta commentary sentences, supply a string explanation in `questions` (it can be a declarative note) and a list of lowercase label strings in `types`. Always include the `sentence_num` and `sentence` fields in each object.

[Example summary]
The memoir follows Dr. Hana Ortiz as she documents a year spent rebuilding a rural clinic after a devastating landslide. She persuades reluctant volunteers to join, negotiates with regional officials to secure supplies, and pilots mobile teams to reach isolated patients. Her final chapters describe the community's renewed trust in local medicine and the clinic's transformation into a training hub.

[Example sentences]
1. To keep the tone balanced, I'm planning to interleave emotional beats with factual updates in this summary.
2. Ortiz designs a rotating shift schedule so staff can visit remote villages without collapsing from exhaustion.
3. The closing section should probably highlight how many pages the original memoir devoted to patient testimonies.
