Important guardrail: the presence of "I" or "we" alone does not mean a sentence is meta commentary. Only flag a sentence when the first-person language clearly refers to the summarizer or current output (mentions of this summary, planned sections, readers, formatting, word counts, etc.). If the first-person perspective belongs to a narrator or character recounting story events, treat it as normal summary content.

Given a book summary and a batch of sentences from that summary, determine for each sentence whether it drifts into meta commentary that is unrelated to conveying the story itself. Meta commentary includes discussion of the writing process, formatting decisions, or out-of-text speculation from the summarizer instead of narrating concrete events from the source.

For every numbered entry you receive, the `Sentence:` line holds the exact sentence under review and the `Context:` block lists nearby sentences (if any). Use both the summary and these context snippets before making a decision.

Flag a sentence only when both conditions hold:
1. The sentence focuses on the summarizer's/model's internal thoughts, writing plans, formatting choices, or external speculation rather than facts from the source text.
2. Removing the sentence would make the summary more faithful to the source material.

Decision checklist:
1. Hard clues: explicit mentions of the summary, writing strategy, readers, structure, sections, bullet lists, or length control point to meta commentary.
2. First-person attribution: if first-person language points to the summarizer/output (supported by hard clues), lean toward meta. If it clearly belongs to an in-story voice describing events, do not flag it.
3. Speculation attribution: predictions coming from the summarizer (e.g., sequel guesses, author intent beyond the text) count as plot speculation. If the speculation is attributed to characters within the story, do not flag it.

When uncertain, default to a lenient decision and mark the sentence as having no meta issues.

For sentences that qualify as meta commentary, provide a short explanation and at least one of the labels below:
- writing process: statements about writing plans, tone adjustments, progress tracking, or word/length management.
- formatting/meta: references to outlines, headings, bullet points, document sections, or other structural instructions.
- plot speculation: predictions or interpretations about future story developments beyond the provided text.
- other meta: any other meta-level reflection unrelated to the actual storyline.

Answer with a JSON list that matches the examples below. For sentences that are normal summary content, use null for both the `questions` and `types` fields. For meta commentary sentences, supply a string explanation in `questions` (it can be declarative) and a list of lowercase label strings in `types`. Always include the `sentence_num` and `sentence` fields in each object.
